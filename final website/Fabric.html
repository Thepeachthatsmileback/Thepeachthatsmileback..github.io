    <h1> How to choose Fabric </h1>  

<div class="Info"></div>
<p>Choosing a fabric is one of the main challenges in first starting a sewing project. Each fabric has different properties ranging from the delicacy of the fabric of the material it is made from. 
    For instance, working with silk requires the Sewist to be gentle with the fabric to cause no damage or stains. 
    Silk is a much more delicate type of fabric as opposed to polyester which is much more resistant to wear and tear.<br><br>
     At first, it can be hard trying to determine the type of fabric you may be working with, especially if the tag has been removed but, over time with enough practice, you will be able to tell what fabric you are using based on the texture alone.
      Here beside this paragraph is the most common types of fabric used, a description of how to identify them, and how you can use them for sewing projects.</p>

<p>While these are the most commonly used fabrics, I will <a href="https://sewport.com/fabrics-directory" class="button button-accent">link here</a> 
    another website that I had used for my research on the types of fabrics and 
    how they are commonly used. Now once you have decided what kind of fabric you want to use for your sewing project, all that is left is to 
    actually purchase/upcycle the fabric of choice. Though there are many different places to shop for fabrics such as JOANN or your local Hobby Lobby, there are times
    where the fabric you need is out of stock. This is where online fabric stores comes into play.
    Here I will list the top stores I buy from online.<br>
