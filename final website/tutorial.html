<div class="step1bio">
         <h3>STEP 1:</h3>
      <p> After gathering all the necessary materials, this project, trace the pattern onto the piece of fabric.
         Remember, you should have three parts in total. 
      </p>
</div>

<div class="step2">

 </div>
         
<div class="step2bio">
           
         <p> In this tutorial, I used two different types of fabric to
            create a contrast between the body and side parts. For the body I used regular cotton and for the sides
            I used minky to get that nice plush texture. Use whatever fabric you would like. You can even use some old clothes 
            and recycle that fabric to make your frog!
         </p>

<div class="step3">

<div class="step3bio">
               <h3>STEP 2:</h3>
            <p> After tracing your pieces, cut them out using your fabric scissors. The picture above shows what it should look like after cutting them out.
            </p>

<div class="step4">

   alt="frog companion">
 </div>
               
<div class="step4bio">
  <h3>STEP 3:</h3>
   <p> 
      After laying them out, take one of the side pieces and place it on top of the body piece where they match up.
Once lined up, hold the pieces of fabric in place and stick the pins so that the pieces are stuck together.
The image above shows how the fabrics should look like after placing the pins in place. It is not necessary to have this 
much pins but I like the stablity of them.

<div class="step5bio">
  <h3>STEP 4:</h3>
   <p> In this step you can either hand sew the pieces together or use a sewing machine. For this example I am using
      my trusty sewing machine in order to sew the pieces together. However, it is totally up to you if
      you want to hand sew your project together. I recommend either a backstitch or a running stitch if you are handsewing.
      If you are using a machine, make sure to take the pins out as you go to prevent breaking your sewing machine. I speak from expereince.

<div class="step6bio">
  <h3>STEP 5:</h3>
   <p> After finishing sewing one side; line up the other side with the body and repeat the process again. 
      Make sure to leave a opening where the frog butt should be. This is where we are going to turn it inside out and put stuffing in.

  <h3>STEP 6:</h3>
   <p> Once sewing both sides to the body, sew the middle part where the sides pieces touch together as shown above.

<div class="step8bio">
  <h3>STEP 1:</h3>
   <p> Gather a handful of stuffing for your plush. Depending how big you made the plush the more stuffing you will need.

 </div>
               
<div class="step9bio">
  <h3>STEP 1:</h3>
   <p> Carefully fill the plush with stuffing. Start with the arms and legs of the plush and ensure that they are well stuffed.
      Afterwards, began filling the rest of the body with the stuffing and make sure not to over stuff it 
      as you still need to finish sewing the rest of the body up.

  <h3>STEP 1:</h3>
   <p> Once stuffed, thread your needle with the string and close the remaining gap with a ladder stitch. A ladder stitch will ensure that the 
      thread is cover once you pull on it to close the hole.
